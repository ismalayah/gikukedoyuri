Marvel has had plenty of successes on both the small and big screens, especially with animation. Since&nbsp;The Marvel Super Heroes&nbsp;cartoon series launched in 1966, Marvel and its roster of characters have featured in many popular animated shows. From shows aimed at young kids and families to mature adult animations, Marvel has an animated show for every taste.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>This variety in Marvel animation content means it can often be hard to know where to start. So if you’re looking for a new show to dive into, here are the10 best Marvel animated series from the expected to the totally forgotten.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-10-marvel-disk-wars-the-avengers-2014 data-injectable=false>10. Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers (2014)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false>What do you get if you cross&nbsp;Marvel&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pokémon&nbsp;with a sprinkling of&nbsp;Ultraman? You get&nbsp;Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers&nbsp;from 2014.</p><p data-characters=607 data-current-count=772 data-injectable=true>Produced by legendary studio Toei Animation, this anime focuses on a group of kids called Akira, Hikaru, Edward, Chris, and Jessica. When Iron Man invents a digital prison to store and rehabilitate supervillains dubbed DISK, things look bright. When Loki arrives and turns the technology against the Avengers, he frees all of the villains and locks most of the heroes in the DISKs.&nbsp;The kids, however, end up with special Bio-Codes that allow them to summon a hero trapped inside a DISK for a short period. Using this skill, the kids find a way to free all of the Avengers and take down Loki for good.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>What makes&nbsp;Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers&nbsp;stand out is how original it is. While it isn’t canon to the modern Marvel universe, the format is different from anything seen before or since. Also, the anime-inspired redesigns of classic Marvel heroes are really neat making it a fun watch, even if just out of curiosity.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-9-ultimate-spider-man-2012 data-injectable=false>9. Ultimate Spider-Man (2012)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>Partially inspired by the&nbsp;Ultimate Marvel&nbsp;line of comics, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultimate Spider-Man</a> follows a younger Peter Parker who is a member of SHIELD. Nick Fury has a plan to help Spider-Man reach his potential as a hero by having Peter mentor a group of heroes. These heroes – Nova, White Tiger, Iron Fist, and Power Man – show potential, however they struggle to co-exist making Peter’s task anything but simple.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>Ultimate Spider-Man featured some great animation. Also, its several episode-long story arcs allowed for some deeper storytelling and character development, making&nbsp;Ultimate Spider-Man&nbsp;stand out against other cartoons of the time. Ultimate Spider-Man also features some fun twists on Spider-Man’s most iconic villains, including Doctor Octopus, Venom, and the Green Goblin.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h- data-injectable=false></h2><h3 id=h-8-marvel-anime-blade-2011 data-injectable=false>8.

The anime&nbsp;follows Blade, a vampire hybrid who can walk in the sun and uses his powers to hunt and kill vampires. Blade heads to Japan when he learns of a vampire group called Existence, hoping that he can slay every vampire in the group at once. This proves easier said than done when Blade finds himself in the center of a massive conspiracy. Also, the mysterious Deacon Frost is watching from the shadows, forcing Blade to confront his own past and his reasons for hunting vampires.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>Part of&nbsp;Marvel Anime: Blade’s&nbsp;appeal is that it is rare to see Blade-focused stories outside of the comics. Also, Madhouse’s animation style really fits the dark, pseudo-gothic world of the vampire hunter, leading to some really memorable visuals.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-7-marvel-anime-wolverine-2011 data-injectable=false>7. Marvel Anime: Wolverine (2011)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>Part of the&nbsp;Marvel Anime&nbsp;sub-franchise animated by legendary anime studio Madhouse,&nbsp;Marvel Anime: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolverine&nbsp;</a>follows the fan-favorite X-Man as he heads to Japan to rescue his girlfriend, Mariko Yashida, from the hands of the crime syndicate Kuzuryu.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>While all of the&nbsp;Marvel Anime&nbsp;entries are praised.&nbsp;Marvel Anime: Wolverine&nbsp;is often considered the best due to the higher than usual age rating and Madhouse’s flair for combat sequences. Because of this, Wolverine’s claws and healing factor are used in many memorable and unique ways, making it stand out against most other&nbsp;X-Men&nbsp;media.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h- data-injectable=false></h2><h3 id=h-6-the-super-hero-squad-show-2009-2011 data-injectable=false>6.

Guardians of the Galaxy follows Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot as they try to find and destroy a legendary weapon called the Cosmic Seed, before a group of villains can get their hands on it and destroy the universe. Later seasons would see the Guardians on other risky missions and come into contact with many of Marvel’s greatest heroes and villains.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=346 data-injectable=false>Guardians of the Galaxy&nbsp;is a fun introduction to the long-running Marvel team and features plenty of exciting action and amusing comedy.
