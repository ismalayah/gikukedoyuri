Lynch says she knows a lot of people are wondering why she chose to team up with her teammates, and she states that it’s to take out Damage CTRL and there’s no better place to do that than in Chicago (cheap pop).</p><p>Belair says Damage CTRL has been sinking low for far too long now, and at War Games, when Damage CTRL goes low, they will go to war. Shotzi starts laughing manically before saying that Damage CTRL made her uncontrollable and unbreakable and she will unleash it all on Damage CTRL. Charlotte says that War Games will be the end of Damage CTRL.</p><p>All this talking of Damage CTRL causes Bayley to make her way out, wearing an Asuka shirt. Bayley says she never thought she’d see the day Charlotte and Becky Lynch stood side by side fighting together. Bayley says in the decade she’s known Charlotte she’s always had something to say about Becky, and that Becky always had something to tell Bayley about Charlotte. Bayley says that being a mother has made Lynch soft. Bayley says that War Games needs a cohesive unit and that Damage CTRL is an actual team.</p><p>Charlotte asks Bayley where her teammates are since Bayley is out here all alone. Lynch interrupts and says she didn’t come here to talk, she came to fight, Lynch challenges any two members of Damage CTRL to a match in tonight’s main event. Bayley accepts the challenge and walks to the back with an evil smile on her face.</p><p>Finn Balor and Damian Priest of The Judgment Day along with Rhea Ripley make their way out to the ring for our upcoming tag team championship match.</p><p>*Commercial break*</p><p>Back live with Bayley meeting up with the rest of Damage CTRL, she asks who wants to take on the tag team match tonight. Dakota Kai tells Bayley that she thinks it should be Bayley in the match tonight teaming up with Asuka. Asuka embraces Bayley as Bayley looks incredibly nervous to team with Asuka.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship: The Judgment Day vs The Street Profits</p><p>Our championship match starts with Dawkins and Priest in the ring. Priest hits a jumping shoulder tackle and tags Balor in the match. Ford tags in and hits Balor with a drop kick before tagging Dawkins back in. Priest makes a blind tag in and Ford hits a lariat to knock Priest out of the ring. Ford goes to dive outside but Balor stops him, Ford is able to knock Balor out of the ring but Ford turns around into a shoulder tackle by Priest to send him flying over the announce table.</p><p>*Commercial break*</p><p>Our championship match continues live with Priest hitting a big drop kick to FOrd. Priest goes for a splash in the corner but Ford gets out of the way. Balor tags in and Ford makes the tag to Dawkins. Dawkins hits a big corkscrew elbow and then an enziguri. Priest runs in and gets a double underhook neck breaker from Dawkins. Ford tags in and Balor is hit with a blockbuster and Ford covers for a two count. Balor hits a slingblade and Priest tags back in and hits a leg drop. Ford and Dawkins hit Priest with the revelation and Ford covers but Balor breaks it up. Ford hits Priest with a superkick and climbs up top. Ripley climbs on the apron and as the ref is distracted Balor trips Ford up on the ropes. Balor tags in as Priest hits a power slam. Balor hits the Coup De Grace and covers for three.</p><p>Winners: The Judgment Day</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Backstage we see Charlotte meeting up with the rest of her team. Charlotte says she spoke with Adam Pearce which causes Becky Lynch to question Charlotte going without her. Lynch and Charlotte start to argue as Belair separates the two. Lynch says she came here to fight tonight and she leaves the locker room. We get a graphic confirming that the match tonight will be Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch against Bayley and Asuka.</p><p>*Commercial break*</p><p>SmackDown returns with the ring set up for another edition of The Grayson Waller Effect. Waller says his guest tonight might be the start of a beautiful friendship. Waller then introduces his guest Kevin Owens….Owens’ music hits and out comes Austin Theory dressed as Kevin Owens.</p><p>Theory sits down as Waller laughs and then the real Kevin Owens comes out to the ring. Waller says Owens is supposed to be suspended, Owens says he was suspended but the suspension ended today. Owens points to Theory and says he hasn’t seen those shorts in months and ass Theory if he went through his bags…Theory fails to deny this. Waller brings up his match last night with LA Knight…which of course brings out LA Knight to a monstrous pop from the crowd.</p><p>LA Knight says that he was happy to let Owens come out there and punch them both out but then they started talking about him. LA Knight says it doesn’t make a difference who was out there, Waller losing to LA Knight is a fact of life. Waller and Theory devise a plan to attack Owens and LA Knight. Owens asks LA Knight if they should attack them now, LA Knight responds with his favorite catch phrase and Owens and LA Knight clear the ring of Theory and Waller quickly.</p><p>*Commercial break*</p><p>Kevin Owens & LA Knight vs Austin Theory & Grayson Waller</p><p>The math begins with Owens hitting Waller with a series of chops in the corner. Owens hits a big uppercut and tags LA Knight in which gets a huge pop. LA Knight hits a lariat and then a snap suplex. Theory pulls the ropes allowing Waller to toss LA Knight over the top rope. LA Knight responds by smashing both Waller and Theory’s heads off the announce tables several times. LA Knight is pulled off the apron by Theory which allows Waller to hit LA Knight with a cheap shot from behind.</p><p>*Commercial break*</p><p>The match continues live with LA Knight flipping out of a back suplex to tag Owens in who knocks Waller out of the ring. Owens hits Waller with a super kick and then Theory gets hit with a cannon ball. Owens goes to the top rope and hits Waller with a swanton, Owens covers for a two count. Theory makes the blind tag and hits Owens with a drop kick. Theory hits a back breaker and Waller tags in and Waller hits an elbow drop. Theory tags in and Waller knocks LA Knight off the apron to prevent the tag. Owens gets isolated in the heel corner and Waller tags back in and goes for the elbow drop but Owens rolls out of the way and tags LA Knight in. LA Knight hits a power slam and follows with his signature elbow drop. Owens runs in to hit a stunner and LA Knight hits the BFT, LA Knight then covers for three.</p><p>Winners: Kevin Owens & LA Knight</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>We go backstage to see Bianca Belair approach Becky Lynch. Belair says that Charlotte is right, and since Lynch made the choice to show up and help, she needs to work to put their differences aside and work together. Becky Lynch says everyone seems to forget that she wants to fight but she assures Belair that she can keep it cool and work together.</p><p>Carlito makes his way out to the ring as commentary alludes to Carlito being the last man standing in the LWO. We will hear from Carlito up next.</p><p>*Commercial break*</p><p>Carlito says tomorrow night will be his first match at a WWE PLE in 13 years, and that’s pretty cool. Carlito says all he can think about is his injured friend Rey Mysterio and getting his hands on the man ho did this, Santos Escobar. Carltio speaks to Escobar in Spanish so that Escobar understands exactly what he is saying. Carlito tells Escobar he made a very big mistake….this causes Escobar to walk out to the ring.</p><p>Escobar responds to Carlito in Spanish before pointing otu Carlito isn’t even wearing the LWO colors. Escobar screams at Carlito that Mysterio and the LWO was always his family and that thanks to the outsider Carlito, his family is no more and Rey Mysterio will never come back.</p><p>Carlito attacks Escobar and the two begin fighting outside the ring. WWE officials run out to separate the two which means we get a Jamie Noble appearance which I will always love. The two men are separate before Escobar runs around to hop the barricade to hit Carlito with a cheap shot.</p><p>*Commercial break*</p><p>Back live with Santos Escobar attacking Carlito backstage. Escobar goes to snap Carlito’s arm but Dragon Lee runs in to make the save with a huricanrana, the best way to save someone from assault.</p><p>Pretty Deadly vs The Brawling Brutes</p><p>The match begins with Holland and Wilson. Holland hits a shoulder tackle and then a right hand to Prince on the apron for good measure. Butch and Prince tag in the match and The Brawling Brutes grab Pretty Deadly and go for the ten beat of the Bodhran. Prince is able to break free and off the distraction Wilson breaks free from Holland. Hollan gets off the apron in frustration and walks to the back leaving Butch all alone. Pretty Deadly hit a double powerslam and Wilson covers for two. Butch begins to fight off both Wilson and Prince. Bitch hits Prince with a brogue kick and covers for two. Butch goes to snap Prince’s fingers. Wilson makes the blind tag and sneaks in the ring with a roll up that gets the three count.</p><p>Winners: Pretty Deadly</p><p>We go backstage where Shotzi meets up with Charlotte. Shotzi says that everyone began to look at her differently but Charlotte never did, and it meant the world to her when she was at her lowest. Shotzi says Charlotte saying just a few words could change things with Becky lynch just like it did for her.</p><p>*Commercial break*</p><p>SmackDown returns live with Nick Aldis being interviewed. Aldis says that Carlito is hurt badly and that he is in no condition to compete tomorrow night and he has no choice but to postpone the match. Dragon Lee approaches Aldis and says he wants to teach Escobar a lesson and Aldis agrees to the match.</p><p>We go to commentary where we see Corey Graves showcasing the absolutely gorgeous Chicago Bears championship belt that one of our equally gorgeous readers should buy for me….anyway the commentary team then gives the rundown of the card for Survivor Series War Games.</p><p>We go to The Judgment Day backstage where they are discussing the War Games match. Priest tells Randy Orton they will make sure that he will never have another come back.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>*Commercial break*</p><p>Charlotte Flair & Becky Lynch vs Bayley & Asuka</p><p>Our main event begins with Bayley and Lynch in the ring.

Lynch and Charlotte argue and Bayley gets a roll up on Lynch for three.</p><p>Winners: Bayley & Asuka</p><p>After the bell Lynch and Charlotte continue to argue with each other.
